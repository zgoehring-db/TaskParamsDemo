# Pipeline Example 

In this demo we will do the following:  
- Ingest JSON data from an API 
- Save the JSON data as a single column Delta table  (bronze)
- Save the JSON data as delta table with the json column and some column extracts (this is just a second bronze table for an example)  
- Set up a data pipeline to process the data from bronze to gold  
- Create a Power BI report using DBSQL
